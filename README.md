# Prolog discovery

## Context 

This project dates back to November 2021.

It has been realized within the scope of the course CS403 - Principles of Programming Languages during my exchange semester at Bishop's University, Canada.

## Description 

This is a introduction to Prolog language and logic programming. 

There is some files given as example, the subject of the exercice in the root and my implementation in the source folder.

As suggested by the name of the course, this is a brief introduction to prolog and the aim was more about theory of logic programming. This explain why the exercice might not seem as difficult as it could have been.

I'd like to address special thanks to Stephan Bruda, the teacher of the course, who has been really plesant to hear through the semester. He has always answered with good knowledge to every question and he is very passionate about its teaching.
